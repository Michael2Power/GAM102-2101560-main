For this module i have been tasked with completing a in-engine diorama to display my skills with working inside of unity, i must great a digital toy which respones to player interation and provides feedback for such interaction.
My proposal for this module is to create a First-Person Puzzle game using different methods of challenging the player and then combining them to give the player a final challenge. 

I beleive that this idea is within the scope of my module and that it is appropriate for my chosen field as it allows me to explore the idea of giving the player a enviroment ot explore as well as responsive mechanics to test them.
